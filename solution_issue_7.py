# Auto-generated code for issue:
# We need to implement a light/dark mode feature for our personal website to improve user experience and accessibility. This feature should be easily accessible via an icon in the navigation bar on every page.

Requirements:
1. Add a toggle icon to the navigation bar that appears on every page of the website.
2. The icon should visually represent light/dark mode (e.g., sun/moon icon).
3. Clicking the icon should switch the website between light and dark color schemes.
4. The chosen mode should persist across page reloads using local storage.
5. Implement smooth transitions between light and dark modes.
6. Ensure all text remains readable in both modes.

Implementation steps:
1. Create CSS variables for color schemes (light and dark).
2. Add the toggle icon to the navigation bar HTML.
3. Implement JavaScript to handle the mode switching:
   - Toggle between light and dark classes on the <body> element.
   - Update the icon to reflect the current mode.
   - Store the user's preference in local storage.
   - Apply the user's preferred mode on page load.
4. Test the feature across different pages and browsers.

Additional considerations:
- Respect the user's system preference for light/dark mode initially.
- Ensure the feature is accessible and can be toggled using keyboard controls.

Please implement this feature and create a pull request with the solution.
